          <p>
            There are many computer-based information systems (CBIS) in hospitals, each of which has different purposes. This exercise will require you to identify the QSEN prelicensure and graduate-level knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) associated with each type of system. In addition, you will relate activities to the Informatics and Healthcare Technologies of AACN’s <em>Essentials of Master’s Education in Nursing</em>.
